# Daniel Hardwick
My name is Daniel Hardwick and I work as a Geographical Information Systems Support Officer. I have worked with GIS for over 10 years and recently deicded to take my knowledge further by enrolling on the MSC in GIS program at the Leeds University. 
My current Module is "Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills" which focuses mainly on the programming language Python, and the practical work involved has resuled in me creating an Agent based model. 

## Assessment 1 - Agent based model (ABM)

The ABM has been created within Spyder, which is a Python development environment. The program focuses on a list of ten agents, which have been assigned a number between 0-99, using the 'random' module. The agents were then plotted using the external library 'matplotlib.pyplot. matplotlib.pyplot', showing the location of each individual agent. 



The random module was used once again to move each agent a random step, allowing each agent to move around randomly. Code was then used to work out the distance between each agent, allowing each agent to know who is near them, essentially allowing the agents to interact. 
A raster file was then introduced into the program, this was used as the agents environment, allowing the agents to interact with it.
